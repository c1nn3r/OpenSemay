# OpenSemay  

Theres a live deployment of this Project on Render here :- https://opensemay.onrender.com, depending on when you decide to open the page the instance might be sleeping so wait for it to load 5-10 seconds to see it.

The sidebar sometimes takes some time to load in properly and the ui is kinda bugged a little bit, you can fix it up and lmk

Alternatively you can clone or download the repo and run it locally which should fix most issues with the load speed and what not but we are gonna have to demonstrate this live on a live server so these issues need to be adressed, and the website uses basic html+css+js so have that in the docs

## To-Do List

1. Fix the proportion of the sidebar – make it more balanced with the rest of the UI.  
2. Clean up the UI – polish layout, spacing, font sizing, etc.  
3. Update the About page – rewrite it to be more concise and human, not generic AI filler.  
4. Change the project name – update all references from "Metekem" to "OpenSemay", including the title tag.  
5. The map is bugged on a mobile Viewport, Fix it if you can, use a PC to see the full version or request the Desktop version of the site on your phone
6. Same topic, the Pin icon(on the map) is Disgustingly bad, fix if you can, replace the icon or do whatever you want with it
7. Apply any random UI improvements as needed.  

If you want to add or remove anything, just push a commit or contact me directly.
